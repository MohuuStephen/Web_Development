    <p> <b>Mickey Mouse</b> first appeared in the animated short <mark> “Steamboat Willie” </mark> <strong> 1928 </strong>, and since then has grown into <b>one of the most recognizable characters around the world</b>. The documentary will explore the highs and lows of the famous mouse and touch on the global phenomenon that is Mickey Mouse, both positive and While the film is said to include some topics considered to be a bit taboo, viewers shouldn’t expect explosive revelations from the documentary. Although according to the film’s director, the documentary is more than just a fluff story about the famous mouse, which is surprising considering how closely Disney has guarded the image of Walt Disney and his beloved Mickey Mouse in the past.

        While the documentary will surely explore the magic, Malmberg has stated that the film will also dive into a few controversial topics that have surrounded Mickey over the past 100 years. However, given the duration of the film, which clocks in at about an hour and a half, he’s aware that any discussion of controversial topics throughout the film won’t necessarily find a hardened resolution. As a result, such topics are unlikely to be explored too deeply, so viewers looking for a tell-all piece about the dark side of Mickey Mouse should find another documentary.</p>
